# Sorting-and-Searching-Visualizer

This Streamlit-based project is designed to visually demonstrate various **sorting and searching algorithms**. It provides an interactive, user-friendly interface to visualize the inner workings of algorithms such as **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Binary Search**, and more. By inputting a set of numbers, users can watch the algorithms sort and search the list step-by-step, with visualizations that help in understanding how these algorithms operate under the hood.

The app is built using **Streamlit** for the interface and **Matplotlib** for plotting the visualizations. It's an excellent tool for anyone learning algorithms or for educators looking to present algorithm concepts in an engaging way.

Key Features:
- Real-time visualization of sorting and searching algorithms.
- Interactive inputs for users to customize the data and algorithm.
- Step-by-step demonstration for better understanding of algorithmic behavior.
- Built with **Streamlit** for smooth and efficient deployment.

This project serves as both an educational resource and a fun tool for anyone interested in learning about algorithmic processes.
